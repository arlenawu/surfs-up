# Summary
Overall, the temperatures in Oahu in December and June are very similar. The greatest difference between the two are the lower temperatures. Temperatures in December can be lower by 5-10 degrees, even though the average temperatures between the two months are very similar -- this suggests that December sees greater fluctuations in temperature, whereas June temperatures are more stable. It would be best to expect a greater degree of unpredictability for the temperature in December.

Two extra queries were run to retrieve the summary statistics for the precipitation in June and December, links to which can be found below. December receives a noticeably greater amount of precipitation than June, which, in addition to the month's potential lower temperatures, may discourage visitors to the beaches. Care should be taken to prepare for slower business in December.
